'''Ingredients
1 pack Maggi instant noodles (70 g)
1 to 1.5 cups water (200–350 ml), depending on your preference for a dry or soupy texture 


Instructions
Boil the water. 
Pour 1 to 1.5 cups of water into a pan and bring it to a rolling boil over a medium-high flame.
Add the noodles and seasoning. 
Add the block of noodles and the entire Tastemaker spice packet to the boiling water. 
You can break the noodles into pieces or leave the cake whole.
Cook for 2–3 minutes.
Stir occasionally as the noodles soften.
Continue to cook until the noodles are tender and the water has been absorbed to your liking. 
Do not overcook, or the noodles will become mushy.
Serve hot. 
Once the noodles are cooked, turn off the heat and transfer them to a bowl. 
Serve immediately to prevent clumping. 


Tasty variations
For a more flavorful, restaurant-style Maggi, you can enhance the basic recipe by adding extra ingredients. 
Masala Maggi: In a separate pan, heat 1 tablespoon of oil. 
Sauté finely chopped onions, garlic, and green chilies. 
Add chopped tomatoes and other vegetables like peas, carrots, or capsicum. 
Stir in the Maggi Tastemaker along with a pinch of turmeric and chili powder. 
Add the boiled noodles to the vegetable mix and toss well.

Cheesy Egg Maggi: Cook the noodles with the Tastemaker as directed. 
Once cooked, whisk one egg and pour it into the noodles, stirring until it scrambles. 
Turn off the heat and mix in a handful of grated cheese until it melts.
Lemon-Garlic Maggi: Sauté finely chopped garlic in butter. 
Once fragrant, add the cooked noodles and Tastemaker. 
Squeeze fresh lemon juice over the top before serving for a tangy twist. '''
